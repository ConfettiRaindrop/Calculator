# Calculator

By Camila Figueira, Sindhura Satti, and Sofiya Chubich

Plan:
    (Camila): Using Swing create a calculator-like object that can take user input and other commands
            Currently commands included will be +, -, *, /, %, and ^. If time allows parantheses will be added. Displays output.

    (Sindhura): Takes user input, processes it, and chunks it into smaller euquations before sending that to the engine

    (Sofiya): runs calculations and returns output, create calculator annoyances (moving buttons, spin, speed)
