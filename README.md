# Calculator

By Camila Figueira, Sindhura Satti, and Sofiya Chubich

Plan:
    Our plan is to create the most annoying calculator possible, from moving buttons, interrupting puns, to stylish music all for a fun and perhaps mildly rage-inducing expirence!

    (Camila): Using Swing create a calculator-like object that can take user input and other commands
            Currently commands included will be +, -, *, /, %, and ^. If time allows parantheses will be added. Displays output.

    (Sindhura): Takes user input, processes it, and chunks it into smaller euquations before sending that to the engine

    (Sofiya): runs calculations and returns output, create calculator annoyances (moving buttons, spin, speed)

    How to run code: take code and hit the run button on whatever IDE you happen to be using, and a calculator will pop up! pressing buttons will cause user input to appear in the text field, and pressing the enter button will cause it to be calculated as calculators do, and a result will be sent back! Have fun exploring different languages, humor, and sounds in our interactive calcuator expirence today!
