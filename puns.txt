Soy Sauce on deez nuts
In Heinz sight

ketchup with deez nuts
I loaf these jokes

I loaf you

I'm not procrastinating, I'm procrustinating!
I'm not procrastinating, I'm prosaucinating!
Look, I know that you love giving me ketchup, but you can't Kikkoman while hes down.
Are you soy about this?
You look soy tired
Try not to be too salty about this
Have you ever been described as SOYdium cholride?
I was looking at the dictionary earlier, but saw some SOYda lime and couldn't check what it meant - do you know?
